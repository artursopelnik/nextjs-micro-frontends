# Next.js Micro Frontends with Multi-Zone and SystemJS

This repository demonstrates how to serve multiple [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) applications from a single domain using [Multi Zones](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/multi-zones).  
Additionally, it showcases how to render multiple micro-frontends on a single page using [SystemJS](https://github.com/systemjs/systemjs).

It also shows how to export web components with Stencil as React components and integrate them with SSR support. 
The alternative with LIT didn't work. LIT web components might work with Page Router. Even the React Generator has bugs. I can't recommend LIT.

## Results

We can load applications both via the route and partially.
Within a zone, we use SSR by default which optimizes the performance within an application.

However, SystemJS only supports the UMD module format, which requires a UMD build.

- Up to **React 18**, this posed no issues.
- As of **React 19**, the React team has officially stopped providing a UMD build. There is still a community-provided UMD build, which works but is no longer officially supported. ([More details](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/31867))

Using ESM and native import maps **without SystemJS** does not work, likely due to Next.jsâ€™s internal handling of modules.
